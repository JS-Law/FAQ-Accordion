## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked
- Navigate the questions and hide/show answers using keyboard navigation alone
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

1. I started this project by thoughtfully creating the elements required and nested them accordingly. 
2. Next, I dove into Sass and began styling with minimal nesting and variable usage. 
3. After I was satisfied with the layout, I started variable declarations for the elements I planned to animate with JavaScript.
4. Once I was satisfied with the functionality of one button, I reused that logic for the remaining buttons and links. 
5. Lastly I added the appropriate styling for the media queries.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I learned quite a bit during this project. Most importantly I learned the proper usage of classes and id's. I might have gone overboard and there was definitely a more concise way to code this but I'm proud of what I brought to the table.

I created the logic behind the accordian elements singularly and afterward, with help from ChatGPT, discovered a way I could have replaced my monolith of event listeners with one single loop that provides all the logic for each listener!

I chose not to implement it because I wanted this project to reflect my current skill level.

I also learned how to style elements with Sass and after a short learning curve, I was blown away by the additional capabilites:
- Mixins
- Nesting
- Variables

I love it! I cant wait to continue to grow with Sass.
### Continued development

In the future, I will recognize more opportunitys to reduce the code I write and to to follow the D.R.Y. principle.

I will also use more Sass functionalities in depth.
